# Liquid App generator 

Maintainer: [Donnie Conner](https://github.com/tastytoast)

> A Yeoman boilerplate template generator for Wildfire Pages.

## Installation

`sudo npm install -g liquid-generator`

This will install the generator globally so you will be able to use it everywhere.

You may need to re-install the generator every time you update Yeoman.

If the install script failed, here is how to install it manually:

`cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/yeoman/node_modules/yeoman-generators/lib/generators`
`git clone git://github.com/romainberger/yeoman-wordpress.git` (you may need to run this with `sudo`)

###Uninstalling

Here is how to uninstall the generator

`cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/yeoman/node_modules/yeoman-generators/lib/generators`
`rm -rf liquid`
